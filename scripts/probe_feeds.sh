# Probe candidate news feeds for reachability, item count, and FRESHNESS.
#
# Latency is the confirmed-entry strategy's dominant cost, and these markets
# resolve on "a consensus of credible reporting" -- not on government press
# releases. So the feeds that matter are credible outlets publishing on their
# OWN infrastructure (minutes) rather than via aggregator indexing (5-15 min+).
#
# A feed is only worth wiring in if it is live AND fresh: an HTTP 200 proves
# nothing (two feeds in this repo returned 200 with zero items for months).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/probe_feeds.sh [path-to-url-list]
